# RestRevApp

With this app you can find restaurants nearby, or in specified city. You can choose the restaurant category, or find any. Moreover, you can specify the name of the restaurant.

App will show you top 10 restaurants that meet your search data criteria.

Then you will be able to see 10 top most reviews (tips) from the users that have been at the chosen restaurant, and add your own tip, that will be visible for another users.

Note: since the app uses Foursquare API you will need to login to foursquare.com web site for using the app. Also, since Foursquare provides top most tips from the users, your recently added tip may not be included into the list of the tip immediately, nevertheless it will be available at foursquare.com.

It was created within the Udacity Senior Web Developer nanodegree programm, and it may be developed as a complete and public available project in the future.


To run the project you will need:
- to install npm ('npm install');
- to install bower ('npm install bower');
- to run the localserver with deployed application via gulp ('gulp dev' or 'gulp release').

When using at local server you will be able to add tips on behalf of the author (Ruslan Dorozhovets), since there is no possibilities to get the user token via localhost. Advanced version can be found at https://ronnieway.com/restrevapp/
